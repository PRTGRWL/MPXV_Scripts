To test run these scripts in the terminal, try:

```
To use flanking_SSR_scripts, user will require three input files i.e. SSR sequence text file, one empty fasta file and a concatenated fasta file of all genomes. Two scripts are there to fetch SSR flanking regions and also to retrieve SSR_flanks common in all 404 genomes. Below are the command lines to use both the scripts.
1. perl script_1.pl input_1.txt input_2.fa 404_genomes.fa >final   {input_2.fa is an empty file}
2. perl script_2.pl
```

### Running the Rscripts
All the R-scripts can be run in an IDE of the user's choice. All required packages are present in the scripts and thus need to be installed. 

MPXV_reference genome infomation has been taken from below link to describe functional category of all genes:
